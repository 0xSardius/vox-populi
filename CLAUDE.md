# Vox Populi - Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview

Vox Populi is a Farcaster miniapp that enables users to stake USDC on Base, earn yield via DeFi protocols, and automatically share a portion with an independent journalism fund. Core innovation: time-weighted yield splitting - longer lock commitments = more yield retained.

**Tagline**: "Earn yield. Fund journalism. Voice of the people."

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16+ (App Router) with React 19
- **Farcaster Integration**: `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk` (NOT MiniKit/OnchainKit)
- **Auth**: Farcaster Quick Auth (`sdk.quickAuth.getToken()`)
- **Chain**: Base (chain ID 8453)
- **Wallet**: Wagmi v2 + Viem for contract interactions
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Foundry), deployed to Base
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- **Database**: Neon Postgres
- **Yield Distribution**: 0xSplits
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Farcaster SDK (NOT MiniKit)
Use the clean Farcaster SDK directly:
```typescript
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'

// Initialize app
await sdk.actions.ready()

// Quick Auth for sessions
const token = await sdk.quickAuth.getToken()

// Get Ethereum provider for wallet
const provider = sdk.wallet.getEthereumProvider()
```

### Yield Split Tiers
| Lock Period | User Keeps | Newsroom Gets |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Flexible    | 25%        | 75%           |
| 3 months    | 50%        | 50%           |
| 6 months    | 60%        | 40%           |
| 12 months   | 75%        | 25%           |

- `FarcasterProvider` + `useFarcaster()` hook (`lib/farcaster/context.tsx`)
- SDK init, Quick Auth token, user context (fid, displayName, pfpUrl)
- Farcaster manifest route (`.well-known/farcaster.json`) - needs domain signing
- MiniApp embed metadata in layout

**Phase 3 - Smart Contracts** ✅
- `VoxVault.sol` (`contracts/src/`) - Core vault with deposits, lock tiers, Aave V3 yield routing, yield splitting, early withdrawal penalty
- `VoxVault.t.sol` (`contracts/test/`) - 17 tests all passing (deposits, yield splits, withdrawals, access control)
- `Deploy.s.sol` (`contracts/script/`) - Base mainnet deploy script
- OpenZeppelin + forge-std dependencies installed

**Phase 4 - Contract Integration** ✅
- VoxVault ABI + ERC20 ABI exported with `as const` type safety (`lib/contracts/`)
- 4 read hooks: `useVaultStats`, `useUserPositions`, `useUsdcBalance`, `useUsdcAllowance`
- 4 write hooks: `useDeposit`, `useWithdraw`, `useClaimYield`, `useApproveUsdc`
- Custom Farcaster wallet connector (`lib/wagmi/farcasterConnector.ts`) using `sdk.wallet.getEthereumProvider()`
- Auto-connect in `FarcasterProvider` when inside Farcaster client
- Deposit page: full approve → deposit → confirm flow with tx status, USDC balance display, success state
- Dashboard: `LivePositionCard` (on-chain reads + real claim/withdraw) and `MockPositionCard` (demo fallback)
- Home page: live TVL/funded from contract with "Demo" badge when vault not deployed
- `tsconfig.json` target bumped to ES2020 for BigInt literal support
- Helper utils: `formatUsdc`, `parseUsdc`, `TIER_ID_MAP`, `TIER_LABELS`, `LockTier` enum

**Phase 4.5 - Local Testing** ✅
- [x] `pnpm build` passes clean (all 5 routes, 0 TypeScript errors)
- [x] All 3 pages render correctly (200 responses, SSR → client hydration)
- [x] Dashboard shows mock position cards in demo mode with "Demo" badge
- [x] Home page shows mock TVL/funded stats with "Demo" badge
- [x] Wagmi hooks safely disabled when vault address is empty (`query: { enabled: isVaultDeployed }`)

- [x] Farcaster `fc:miniapp` meta tag present with correct schema
- [x] Dev server runs with zero errors in console

### In Progress / Next Up

**Phase 5 - Skipping Sepolia, Going Straight to Mainnet** ⏭️
- Sepolia deployed (`0x3Ef45c16...`) but Aave faucet minting was blocked (owner-restricted `mint()`)
- Decision: skip testnet, deploy to Base mainnet with small real amounts ($1-5 USDC)
- Base mainnet gas is fractions of a penny, contract has 17 passing tests, risk is minimal
- MIN_DEPOSIT lowered to 1 USDC to enable cheap testing

**Phase 5b - Base Mainnet Deployment** 🔜 ← **START HERE NEXT SESSION**
- [ ] Generate or provide deployer wallet with Base ETH (need ~$0.01 for gas)
- [ ] Set newsroom fund address (can be deployer for initial testing)
- [ ] Deploy VoxVault to Base mainnet via `contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol`
- [ ] Update `CONTRACTS.VOX_VAULT[base.id]` with deployed address
- [ ] Switch `ACTIVE_CHAIN` from `baseSepolia` back to `base` in `lib/wagmi/config.ts`
- [ ] End-to-end test: approve 1 USDC → deposit → view position on dashboard → claim → withdraw
- [ ] Vercel deployment with `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` env var

**Phase 6 - Backend & Data** 🔜
- [ ] Neon Postgres setup (optional for MVP - can use on-chain reads only)
- [ ] API routes: `/api/positions`, `/api/yields`, `/api/stats`
- [ ] Contract event indexing for historical data
- [ ] Leaderboard data

**Phase 7 - Polish & Social** 🔜
- [ ] Share cards after deposit (Farcaster cast composer)
- [ ] Farcaster manifest domain signing
- [ ] Notifications
- [ ] Error boundaries + loading skeletons
- [ ] Accessibility audit

**Phase 8 - Mainnet Launch** 🔜
- [ ] Security review of VoxVault contract
- [ ] Deploy to Base mainnet
- [ ] Set up newsroom fund multisig address
- [ ] Final Farcaster miniapp registration

**Phase 9 - RNBW Token Staking** 🔜
- [ ] Research RNBW token (contract address, chain, tokenomics)
- [ ] Design separate RNBWVault contract (different yield strategy from USDC vault)
- [ ] Determine yield source for RNBW (staking rewards? LP? custom?)
- [ ] Build + test RNBWVault with Foundry
- [ ] Frontend: multi-vault UI — token selector on deposit page
- [ ] Deploy RNBWVault to Base

### Key Decisions Made
- Using Farcaster SDK directly (not MiniKit/OnchainKit)
- Cinzel serif font for display text (Roman inscription aesthetic)
- CSS-only animations (no framer-motion dependency)
- Single VoxVault contract for MVP (no separate strategy contracts). RNBW staking will be a separate vault (Phase 9).
- MIN_DEPOSIT lowered from 10 USDC to 1 USDC — dust deposits just earn zero yield, no risk
- Simplified yield tracking (pro-rata from aUSDC balance)
- Wagmi v3 (latest, matches wagmi skill)
- Custom `createConnector` for Farcaster wallet (with `Promise<any>` return to handle v3.4 `withCapabilities` generic)
- Demo mode: pages gracefully fall back to mock data when vault not deployed or wallet not connected
- Hooks use `query: { enabled }` pattern to prevent calls when address/vault unavailable
- `ACTIVE_CHAIN` pattern: single variable in wagmi config controls which chain hooks target; swap from `baseSepolia` → `base` for mainnet launch

### Lessons Learned

**TypeScript / Build**
- `tsconfig.json` target must be ES2020+ to use BigInt literals (`0n`). The Next.js default (ES2017) doesn't support them.
- Always use `as const` on ABI arrays for Viem/Wagmi type inference. Without it, `functionName` and `args` lose type safety entirely.

**Wagmi v3**
- Wagmi v3.4 added a `withCapabilities` generic to the connector `connect()` method. Custom connectors need `Promise<any>` return type to avoid type conflicts. Annotate the factory function as `CreateConnectorFn`.
- Use `query: { enabled: boolean }` on all read hooks to prevent calls when addresses are undefined or vault isn't deployed. This is the Wagmi equivalent of conditional fetching.
- `useConnectors()` is a separate hook in v3 (not returned from `useConnect()`).

**Farcaster SDK**
- Must use dynamic `import('@farcaster/miniapp-sdk')` inside the Wagmi connector to prevent SSR crashes. The SDK assumes `window` exists.
- Auto-connect logic lives in `FarcasterProvider` — when SDK is ready + inside Farcaster client + not already connected, it finds the `farcaster` connector by ID and calls `connect()`.

**Architecture Patterns**
- **Demo mode pattern**: Every page should gracefully fall back to mock data when the vault isn't deployed or wallet isn't connected. Use a simple `isLive` boolean and "Demo" badge so devs and users always know which state they're seeing.
- **Guard before you call**: `isVaultDeployed` is computed once at module level from the config. Read hooks check it; write hooks are only triggered by user clicks, so they naturally won't fire when there's no vault.
- Parallel agent work (UI + contracts simultaneously) is efficient but requires careful commit separation — keep frontend and contract commits distinct for cleaner git history.

**Deployment**
- Aave V3 on Base Sepolia uses its own mock USDC (`0xba50...`), NOT Circle's testnet USDC (`0x036C...`). Must mint via https://staging.aave.com/faucet/. This tripped us up initially.
- The Aave mock USDC token's `mint()` is owner-restricted. The owner is a faucet/ACL contract (`0xD914...`), not the Aave Faucet UI contract (`0xf2a2...`). Direct `cast send` minting doesn't work — use the staging.aave.com/faucet UI instead (connect wallet, select Base Sepolia, mint USDC).
- `contracts/.env` `source` does not work reliably in git bash on Windows. Use inline `export VAR=value &&` or set vars directly when running cast commands.
- `foundry.toml` etherscan config eagerly resolves env vars even when not verifying. Comment out the `[etherscan]` section if `BASESCAN_API_KEY` is not set, or the deploy script will fail.
- `cast wallet new` generates a fresh deployer — cheap and disposable for testnets. Fund via Superchain/Alchemy/Coinbase faucets.
- Base Sepolia L2 gas is extremely cheap (~0.000004 ETH for a full contract deploy).

**Tooling / DX**
- Windows creates literal `nul` files when shell output is redirected to `NUL` (case-sensitive filesystem issue). Clean these up with `rm -f nul`.
- `pnpm build` is the single source of truth for TypeScript correctness. Run it after any significant changes.
- Foundry submodule deps (`forge-std`, `openzeppelin-contracts`) show as modified in `git status` — this is normal and doesn't need to be committed unless versions changed.
